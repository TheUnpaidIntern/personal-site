      A synthesiser for the industrial design process
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-12">
      The Unpaid Intern was my graduation project at CSM in 2015 - imagine a
      synthesizer for 3D models. Drop in any CAD file and explore the design
      space through intuitive controls, just like a musician shaping sound. The
      interface lets you save presets and collaborate naturally, without
      everyone needing to huddle around a computer. Say your team wants to
      capture the feeling of midwest emo in product form - you can use the tool
      to explore what details make something feel like Never Meant by American
      Football. Save that direction as a preset, amplify those characteristics
      or tone them down, blend it with post-punk influences, then hand the
      controls to your colleagues to explore further without needing CAD
      expertise. Like working with a helpful intern, it takes your vague
      creative direction and returns with countless variations, ready for
      feedback and refinement. While most AI tools at the time were trying to
      take over the entire creative process, I wanted to explore how algorithms
      could enhance rather than replace traditional design workflows.

      This project opened up a path I hadn't expected. Back in 2015, I was
      focused on industrial design - dreaming about working at places like
      Barber Osgerby. But when everyone started calling this an 'interaction
      design' project, I figured I should probably learn what that meant.
      Looking at what was coming out of the RCA at the time, especially through
      Durrell Bishop's influence, I realized that was exactly the direction I
      needed to go. While I had these ideas about generative tools and AI
      augmentation, I barely knew how to prototype them - coding wasn't
      something I'd really explored. The concept of collaborating with AI wasn't
      new even then, but it's evolved enormously since 2015. Looking back, this
      project started me down a rabbit hole of exploring human-AI collaboration
      in design, one that I'm still following today.
