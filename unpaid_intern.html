            Drop in your CAD files and explore the latent space of your
            concepts. The controller works as a way for the algorithm to live on
            the table amongst the sketches and models.

            The interface lets you save presets and collaborate naturally,
            without everyone needing to huddle around a computer. Say your
            client wants to 'make it more jazzy' - you can quickly explore what
            details make something feel jazzy. When you find it, you can save
            that direction as a preset, amplify those characteristics or tone
            them down, maybe blend in some post-punk influences, let the client
            use the dials to fade between Miles Davis and Moses Boyd. In this
            case you're not only exploring you're working on finding a shared
            language to work in.

            In the summer before working on this I had been working as an
            unpaid<sup class="font-bold font-size-sm pl-[2px]">1</sup>
            editorial intern for ICON magazine writing first drafts and
            exploring topics for the editors. This is kind of the same, it'll
            take your vague creative direction and returns with countless
            variations, ready for feedback and refinement.

            Or at least that was the concept, the Unpaid Intern was my
            graduation project at Central Saint Martins in 2015 - and the first
            sign that I should move from industrial design to interaction
            design. I had these ideas about generative tools and AI
            augmentation<sup class="font-bold font-size-sm pl-[2px]">2</sup>, I
            barely knew how to prototype them - software and electronics were
            all peripheral to what I had been focussed on. But teaching myself
            to prototype them set me down the path I'm on today.

            The project took on a life of its own after graduation, becoming
            part of the Vitra Design Museum's 'Hello Robot' exhibition on the
            past present and future of our relationship with robots. It ended up
            travelling around the world from 2017 until 2023. And it was fun to
            see it be part of that larger conversation about how we relate to
            AI, especially as the hype started growing.

              There was AI in the air at Kings Cross back then, Deepmind was the
              first of the Google companies to move in to that campus, and they
              were hard at work prepping for the Lee Sedol match the following
              spring. I hand-made an invite to our degree show and to try get
              Demis to come to my degree show.
