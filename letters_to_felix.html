          This project was created alongside Alex Penman during our 7 week
          residency at Laboratory Spokane. Follow @Auxillius.cord on instagram

          Our goal was to get non-experts involved in exploring and
          understanding Augmented Reality (AR). To this end we made an
          educational program called "Letters to Felix" where we make the same
          AR experience at 3 levels of complexity, so that everyone at home can
          follow along. Over the course of the episode you'll not only be
          exposed to the past, present, and future of the technology, but you'll
          also be taught the theory and skills needed to start experimenting and
          developing your own experiences.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The show is made in the style of old 70's and 80's educational
          programs, in order to be more distinct and engaging than a youtube
          tutorial. With the increasing influence that XR technologies such as
          AR and VR are having on our lives, it is important that everyone can
          be part of the conversation about their future.
