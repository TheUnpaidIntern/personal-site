      Our goal was to get non-experts involved in exploring and understanding
      Augmented Reality (AR). To this end we made an educational program called
      "Letters to Felix" where we make the same AR experience at 3 levels of
      complexity, so that everyone at home can follow along. Over the course of
      the episode you'll not only be exposed to the past, present, and future of
      the technology, but you'll also be taught the theory and skills needed to
      start experimenting and developing your own experiences. The show is made
      in the style of old 70's and 80's educational programs, in order to be
      more distinct and engaging than a youtube tutorial. With the increasing
      influence that XR technologies such as AR and VR are having on our lives,
      it is important that everyone can be part of the conversation about their
      future.
