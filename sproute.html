    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">
      Sproute is a navigation app that diversifies how you travel by offering a
      set of characters that get you to your destination in different ways. For
      example maybe you want to avoid dark and unlit streets at night, or maybe
      you could go sightseeing on the way to your destination?
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-12">
      Sproute was the outcome of my 4 month residency with Move Lab: an urban
      mobility lab based in Berlin. Particular thanks goes to Florian Porada who
      was the developer on the project and translated my design into a working
      app. The lab also have a project page for Sproute, and a couple of blog
      posts which I recommend checking out.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Meet the team</h2>

    <p class="mb-12">
      This initial ensemble of characters were chosen to appeal to different
      facets of a person's needs, and also to exemplify the scope of potential
      future characters: from precise functionality, to open-ended exploration.

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">How did this come about?</h2>

    <p class="mb-12">
      With Sproute I wanted to continue evaluating the ideas that I had come up
      with during my Agency Agency project. Namely that user friendliness
      doesn't mean focusing on efficiency and “frictionless” experiences.

    <p class="mb-12">
      Most navigation apps are built on the assumption that the most useful
      route for you is always the fastest and most efficient. Sproute tries to
      question this assumption. Instead, asking how many different routes could
      we get from A to B? And what other routes could we take if we added a
      couple of minutes to our journey time?

    </ul>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">What was the process?</h2>
    <p class="mb-12">
      Using the framework from the research paper “What do prototypes
      prototype?” I planned my own prototypes according to their model of Role,
      Look and Feel, and Implementation.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Role</h3>
    <p class="mb-12">
      A few weeks into the project I presented my progress to 60 employees in
      the company, and used the opportunity to try out the design directions
      that had started to bubble to the top. I randomly assigned an activity for
      each person to do over a 2 week period. Since this was more about the
      behaviours, I designed a set of cards that told them what to do, rather
      than losing time trying to program the experiences.
    </p>
    <img

    <img

      alt="Description of GIF 3"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <p class="mb-12">
      After the 2 weeks I gathered the participants back and lead a short
      workshop. Amazingly the role playing aspects of some of the more oddball
      activities, such as asking people to pretend to be stealthy ninjas, had
      actually led to the most engagement and reflection among participants.
      This power of characters and role play to get people to behave differently
      than they usually would was what we tried to harness in Sproute.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Implementation</h3>
    <p class="mb-12">
      Digging through and testing out the “alternate route” functions in the
      Graphhopper API allowed me to quickly understand how the various
      parametres affected what routes we could generate. All the street-light
      and landmark data, as well well as the map graphs themselves came from
      Open Street Map (OSM). The open source nature of OSM means that
      unfortunately the app itself is biased towards communities where there is
      more available data (usually well-populated western countries), but in the
      future the hope is to encourage Sproute users to contribute back to OSM in
      areas where the data is incorrect (e.g missing streetlights).
    </p>

    <img
      src="images/sproute_technical_prototype.gif"
      alt="Description of GIF 3"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <p class="mb-12">
      Many of the algorithm ideas, as well as the final implementations and code
      were made by Florian Porada, who was in charge of programming the
      functioning Sproute app.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold">Look and feel</h3>
    <p class="mb-12">
      Once the idea of using character based routing was settled on, and we had
      verified that it would be possible to translate it into code, the next
      challenge was making this new framework feel approachable.
    </p>
    <img

      alt="Description of GIF 3"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <p class="mb-12">
      Paper prototypes led me to the idea of re-contextualising the character
      selection screens from games like Mario Kart and Street Fighter. Using a
      familiar and simple interaction also helps transmit the concept behind
      Sproute to any newcomers.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Applied Speculation</h2>
    <p class="mb-12">
      My hope is that, if nurtured correctly, Sproute could start to evolve from
      a proof of concept to an open-sourced routing platform. Which is to say,
      rather a place for sharing specific routes, it would be a place to share
      the algorithms that create those kinds of routes.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-12">
      A central repository of routing algorithms would give research groups and
      hobbyists a-like a centralised place to share their creations. Bundling
      functionalities in the same platform means that certain gate-way
      characters can help people build trust in the rest of the system and then
      eventually branch out into the more eccentric characters.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">
      How would you get lost in a self driving car?
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-12">
      The last thing to mention is the role that non-linear navigation could
      play in a future in which we end up with autonomous vehicles, or even in
      the milder future where we become even more reliant on our mapping apps.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-12">
      Taking a wrong turn or getting lost can be a blessing rather than a curse.
      It affords us the opportunity to explore our environments and learn new
      things about familiar places. Understanding efficiency and utility to mean
      “As Soon As Possible” means we'll lose those moments of discovery: how can
      you get lost in a self-driving car? Non-linear routing like what we've
      explored in Sproute could be a way of introducing a little more
      uncertainty back into the system.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-12">
      However Sproute's aim isn't just to offer a new way of getting around, it
      is to show the assumptions and interactions that are taken for granted
      across all of our interactions with technology, not just mobility.
